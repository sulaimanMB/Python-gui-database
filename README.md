# LAMIS-GUI-DATABASE
This project is built using Python programming language and features a Graphical User Interface (GUI) implemented through the use of tkinter library. The application takes user inputs via designated input fields and saves this data locally onto the user's system in a database. The project runs smoothly without errors, demonstrating sound programming principles and effective implementation of intended functionality. Additionally, I designed the interface with care and attention, ensuring ease of use and accessibility.
