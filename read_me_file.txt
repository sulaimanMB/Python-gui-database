hello good day sir, 

this is some project i had worked on last year(its a data entry app which we can enter data and it would save it into the database that will be created locally) just for fun, it would be a lot if u could check it out for me and lay out your critics on it , it is very basic.... so dont be overwhelemed sir

i have implemented great logic in the coding time and have gone to great lenghts to rid it of all errors this i can assure , since then i havent coded anything big, i am even doubting myself of whether i can make something as good as this project i have made in the past year.

i am thinking of programming a more complex application with robust functionalities for a  student result collation and assessing system ,particularly secondary schools around my local government area because all academic activities (tests and exams )are recorded with pen and paper manually , this results in great error and takes much of the teachers time....

i would like to know your review and suggestions and also advice you would give me to succeed in this great field.

thank you s
